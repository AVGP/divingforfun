My buddy Ana and I are both based in Zurich and a nice site to take pictures, try new equipment and practice various skills is the Wassersportzentrum Tiefenbrunnen.

The infrastructure at WZT is great: There is a filling station to fill our bottles and the stairs make entering and exiting the water very comfortable.Public restrooms and parking make the site a great place for a quick plunge.

We do a little tour of the site whenever we are done with exercises or fiddling with new stuff.

We meet Ferdinand, the lion, check for crocodiles as recommended and hang out with the garden gnome before going to pay the sunken boat a visit, too.

## February

The year at WZT starts with a night dive. My buddy Ruben lead the dive as my local dive guide. We visited the lion statue Ferdinand, discovered that the dive bell is broken and we swim under the pipe to the boat wreck.
