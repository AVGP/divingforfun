When starting as a scuba diver, beginners wonder what scuba diving equipment you need and in what order to buy it, when you're on a budget.

## Scuba diving gear for beginners

The bare minimum open water scuba diving equipment includes the following parts:

1. **Scuba diving mask** to see something underwater
3. **Fins** to efficiently move around underwater
4. **BCD (buoyancy control device)** to increase or decrease your buoyancy as needed
5. **Regulator** to deliver air from your cylinder during the dive
6. **SPG (submersible pressure gauge)** to check how much air you have left in your tank
7. **Cylinder** to carry air for your dive
8. **Dive computer** to control how long and how deep you dive

Please note that these things are the absolute bare minimum scuba diving gear.
For a safe diving there are standards set by training agencies such as [PADI](https://padi.com) which may include additional equipment.
PADI, for example, requires the following additional parts in your scuba diving gear:

- **Alternate second stage** so your buddy can breathe from your cylinder in an emergency
- **Snorkel** so you can save the air in your cylinder and protect your airways while at the surface
- **Droppable weight** if needed to establish neutral buoyancy or to perform exercises
- **Wetsuit or Drysuit** if appropriate for the environment you are diving in
