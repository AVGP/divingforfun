## Summary

Difficulty     | max. Depth | Notes
 --------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Easy / Medium | 10-30m     | Can be done shallow or deep. Usually lots of fish near a tree at 12m.

Zigeunerplätzli is a nice dive site for both a wall dive as well as an easy shallow dive with lots of fish.

## Dive plan

Walk down the path through the trees towards the gravel beach.
Put your fins on in the shallow water then swim a few meters out to descent. The slope goes towards the edge of the wall at 15 meters.
Dive to the right along the wall (wall on right shoulder).

The wall has small overhangs, crevasses and holes for fish to hide in. After a while, the wall makes a right turn, forming a bit of a bay, then turns back to the left and continues. Around 20 minutes into the dive you can start shallowing up on a sandy plateau to 12m.

Turn back (shore on the left shoulder) and go along the wall. After a few minutes you will reach a big tree at 12-14m. You can often see lots of pikes and egli there. Continue along the wall, shallowing up to 8m. You may find a slate in the wall, commemorating the last dive of the swiss army divers in 1979. Keep ascending until you find the slope at 5-6m. When you arrive at sea grass, you are back at the exit.
