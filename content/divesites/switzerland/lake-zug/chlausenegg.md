## Summary

Difficulty    | max. Depth | Notes
--------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
Medium / Hard | 40+.       | Wall dive, depth 60+ meters, watch your NDL, depth and gas supply.

Rather deep and steep wall dive along a beautiful wall. The tree at 42 meters looks stunning and depending on the time of the year, you may find lots of fish along the wall and at the trees.

 ## Dive plan
 
Enter the water via the metal stairs. Make sure to have some air in your BCD as the ground is at ~10m, sloping towards the wall.
Descend towards the right along the wall, slowly going down to 40m. Around 15 minutes into the dive you should see a big tree. Fish like to hang out around the tree.
As the tree is at 45m pointing even deeper, make sure to watch your gauges.

Go further along the wall, ascending slowly to 16m and you should find another, smaller tree. There you can turn around and dive back along the top of the wall until you reach the exit at the stairs.
