## Summary

Difficulty     | max. Depth | Notes
 --------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Easy / Medium | 10-40m+    | Can be done shallow or deep.<br>The wall slopes deep, so watch your depth and air!

Versatile dive site that is interesting at a range of depths. Great for night dives thanks to lots of fish and ease of navigation.

## Dive plan

Carefully go down the stone steps - the rope is mostly useful for exiting, not for entering the water.

After entering the water, go towards the right side for a medium to deep dive or to the left side for a shallow dive near the seaweed.

### Shallow option

Going to the left of the entrance, you will find a plateau between 5 and 10 meters deep. Stay near the plants at the shore, there's often a large number of fish there. After 15-20 minutes, you will see the poles of the jetty, turn the dive there and follow the shore line on the right shoulder until you see a gap in the sea grass, that's the exit.

### Deeper option

Going to the right of the entrance at approximately 16m. Keep going at 16m for 15-20 minutes to reach a tree next to the foot of the wall. Follow the wall (wall on your right shoulder) and watch your depth and gas supply as the wall slopes down deeper and deeper as you go. There are lots of crevasses where burbots like to hide. Turn back at the wall and follow it upwards again, then turn left at 15 meters.

You will come across a traffic-sign looking season's greeting from DiveZone, then slowly shallow up to 8m until you see a floating sign for Daniela's "1000th dive". Look for a gap in the sea grass at the shore nearby - that is the exit.
