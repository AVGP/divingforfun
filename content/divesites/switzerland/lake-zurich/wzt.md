## Summary

 Difficulty | max. Depth | Notes
 -----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
 Easy       | 24m        | Courses are often taught here, <br>so visibility is often not so great

WZT is a great dive site when you want to try new equipment or train some skills.
There is some stuff to see here and during summer there are usually lots of fish around the entrance and along the pipe.

## Dive plan

Enter via the stairs, descent straight from the stairs to 3m and continue to 6m where there should be a free-hanging chain.
This chain is great to do a few bouyancy exercises in a drysuit or for using it as a visual reference during exercises.
Continue straight to 9m where there should be a chain on the ground. Along this chain are two lion statues and if you swim to the right, the chain meets another chain and a garden gnome at 11m. Following the chain that goes deeper, you will get to a concrete ring at 18m. Swim in a 45° angle to the left of the chain and you should see a boat wreck at 19m. 
If you continue swimming straight, you reach two poles. At the poles there are an alien figure, a headless statue and a shisha.
At the poles you should see a thin pipe on the ground. Stay on this side of the pipe and start ascending along the slope. Around 16m, you will see another boat wreck on your left. Depening on the visibility, you should also see a big pipe above you. Follow this pipe towards shallower depth.
At around 8m, turn left and stay at this depth. You should find the chain on the ground again. Shallow up further and you will get back to the entrance.
