## Summary

 Difficulty  | max. Depth | Notes
 ------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Easy/Medium | 38m        | Lots of fish in summer and autumn, Oscar at 32m, treasure chest at 38m.

Relatively easy dive site, can be done as a shallow or a deeper dive. Great for night dives, not so great for exercises due to the silt bottom.
The resident skeleton "Oscar" and lots of fish in summer and autumn make this a lovely site for a quick dive.

## Dive plan

Enter via the stairs. For a deep dive, you can continue 180Â° from the stairs and go down the wall. You may see a little figurine at 22 meters.
Follow the wall to the left (wall on right shoulder) at 32m and you will find Oscar sitting on a chair after ca. 10 minutes.
Either continue and go further down to 38m to find a treasure chest at the foot of the wall or start ascending and turn the dive at 16-10 meters.
If you go further than the entrance, you will find lots of sea grass and fish in the evenings during summer and autumn.
