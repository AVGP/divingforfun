## Summary

Difficulty | max. Depth | Notes
 ----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Easy      | 16m        | Lots of crayfish, a few figurines and a sunken springboard tower await.

Easy dive along a very gentle slope. Some navigation skills are required to find the points of interest.
Usually lots of crayfish hanging out in crevasses and under rocks.

Public restrooms, tables and benches make this dive site really comfortable and the roof over the terrace helps with suiting up during rainy days.

## Dive plan

Walk down from the parking lot, along the right-hand side of the lawn and across the little creek.
Enter the water at the gravel beach and dive along the jetty down to 14m, then turn to ~350째 and stay at 14 meters.
You will find a lounge chair ca. 5min into your dive at 14m, there you turn to ~345째. After a few minutes you will see the chain of a buoy.
Continue at 15-16m towards 345째 and you should come to a group of figurines after a total dive time of ca. 15 minutes. Shortly afterwards you should see big wooden poles. Dive along them and you will come across an old, sunken springboard tower reaching from 16m to 14m. 

Air permitting, you may continue onwards to a small wall with holes where lots of crayfish hide. In general, crayfish are pretty much all over this place all year round, though.

Go back around 12 meters until you see the poles of the jetty. The corner is marked with a piece of metal next to the pole. After the corner, turn towards shore and exit.
