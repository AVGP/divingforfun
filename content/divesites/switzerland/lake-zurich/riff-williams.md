## Summary

Difficulty | max. Depth | Notes
-----------|------------|-------
Easy       | 25         | Usually lots of fish in summer and autumn.<br>Nice and easy to navigate, great for night dives.

This dive site is a really nice site for a quick dive in Lake Zurich. Especially in the evenings it's usually full of egli, pikes and burbots.
It is a pretty flexible dive site - you can stay shallow above the wall at 10-5 meters, you can go along the wall at 20-10 meters or you can go along the bottom (fish stay around here in winter) at 25-20 meters.

Navigation is relatively easy: You can either count the chains to the buoys or use time to figure out your way back. Go along the wall and then turn 180 when you want to turn the dive - shallow up to 5m and look for the stone platform to find the entrance.

## Dive plan

Entering the lake can be done via the ladder onto a stone platform. This is often quite slippery, so be careful and put some air into your BCD.
Descent from the platform along the steep slope to ~20 meters, take the wall on the right shoulder and go right along the wall.

The wall has lots of little holes and you find plateaus at different depths along the wall.

There are numerous buoys anchored near the wall, so you can count the chains for the way back.

After 25 to 30 minutes at 24 meters, you should come across a big tree trunk where there are a bunch of gnomes, at 23m there is a traffic marker. You can shallow up there and dive back to the exit.

Do not dive to the left of the entrance as there's an active boat pier there.
