## Summary

Difficulty | max. Depth | Notes
 ----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Easy      | 12m        | Lots of curious trouts. Bring your camera and hope for sunshine!

Lake Blausee is a small lake in a scenic park at 887m above sea level. The lake is quite shallow and fed from underwater springs.
The lake is a gem - clear blue water, lots of curious trouts (they're used to divers) and a quaint statue invite divers to take the scenic route underwater and bring their cameras along.

The lake is privately-owned. Information on getting a permit to dive can be found on the [website of the Hotel Blausee](https://blausee.ch).

Talk to the hotel reception to get the code for the gate to the chalet parking.
Drive up the little road (lots of signs tell you that it's not the access to Blausee), enter the code, drive through the gate.
You can load your gear into the little, heated chalet and go from there.

## Dive plan

Go down to the lake when the sun is up, enter the water at the little step below the sun terrace of the hotel. Take a tour along the shore, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. A round trip takes 30 minutes, but can take longer when you take pictures or film.

The round tour is 6-8 meters, the center of the lake is deeper but also covered with a thick layer of lime particles from the underwater springs.
