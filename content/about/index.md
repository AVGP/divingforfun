Welcome to my dive blog! I am a pretty new diver from Switzerland and want to share my dive stories with you on this website.

## Becoming a diver

It has always been a dream of mine to go and explore underwater worlds and when the opportunity presented itself, I got my open water diver certification in March 2019 on the Seychelles.

As a next step, I learned how to dive in a dry suit, so I could explore the local lakes and other colder waters.

After trying out a dry suit dive with Robert and Chris from [Tauchbasis Zwenkauer See](https://tauchbasis-zwenkauer-see.de/), I took my dry suit course with Florian from <a href="https://tsk.ch">TSK</a> in Zurich in July. While I was at it, I also added the Nitrox certification with Roni there.

Then, in 2019, I began diving more actively. I took my advanced open water diver certification in January 2020 and then started diving regularly in cold water afterwards.
